## Testing 

## AI transparency 
<details>
  Microsoft Copilot automatic commit message generator in GitHub was used. However, all commits from VS Code were written by me with no input from AI. There is also no AI-generated code in this project, nor was it used for debugging, as this project was undertaken to challenge my front-end skills (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), so its use would have undermined this goal.
